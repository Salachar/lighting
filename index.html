<template id="1">
<p>The CANVAS!</p>
<p>
The canvas is the backbone of this whole
thing, and we'll be using the 2D context instead of WebGL.
</p>
<pre>
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
document.body.appendChild(canvas);
</pre>
<p>
We're now ready to draw the image to the canvas. The canvas needs a javascript
image instance to draw, so we'll need to make that first. After the image loads
we'll use it's dimensions to resize the canvas.
</p>
<pre>
const img = new Image;
img.onload = () => {
    const width = img.naturalWidth;
    const height = img.naturalHeight;

    canvas.setAttribute('width', width);
    canvas.setAttribute('height', height);
    canvas.style.width = width + 'px';
    canvas.style.height = height + 'px';

    context.drawImage(img, 0, 0, width, height);
}
img.src = 'graph.png';
</pre>
<p>
The width and height of a canvas can be accurately pulled from
it's context. This is handy when clearing a context before drawing.
</p>
<pre>
const width = context.canvas.width || context.canvas.clientWidth || 0;
const height = context.canvas.height || context.canvas.clientHeight || 0;
</pre>
</template>


<template id="layers">
<p>Using the canvas in layers is crucial to maintain any sort of performance.</p>
<p>
While the 2D context is pretty fast at drawing, redrawing everything everytime we need to add/remove
something will slow it down drastically.
</p>
<p>
Canvas layers need to be stacked on top of each other, using whichever method you want.
I tend to stick to positioning them absolute inside of a wrapper, and using z-index to layer them.
Each time a new layer is added, the order will be explicitly called out.
</p>
<p class="note">
NOTE: Each added layer will be the same size, and they should all be resized after the image loads.
</p>
<pre>
.wrapper {
    position: relative;
    width: *some width*
    height: *some height*;
    overflow: scroll;
}

// target all canvases, these will be in the .wrapper div
canvas {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    background: transparent;
}

.image_canvas {
    z-index: 0;
}
// Mentioned in the next few slides
.wall_canvas {
    z-index: 1;
}
</pre>
<p>I'll also be using a helper for clearing the context in future examples.</p>
<pre>
function clear (context) {
    context.clearRect(0, 0, context.width, context.height);
}
</pre>
</template>


<template id="walls">
<p>
Now we need to add some walls. We'll start by creating an array
to hold our wall objects. The below is just a sample, every other wall will
be included using the same structure.
</p>
<pre>
const walls = [
    {
        "p1": {
            "x": 217,
            "y": 138,
        },
        "p2": {
            "x": 217,
            "y": 430,
        },
    },
];
</pre>
<p>
Now we want to draw them so we can see them on the screen.
We'll use another canvas layer to draw the walls on, the order of the canvases
should be as follows: (left/lowest -> right/highest)
<br /><br /><b>IMAGE -> WALL</b><br />
</p>
<pre>
walls.forEach((wall) => {
    const context = wall_context;
    context.save();
        context.beginPath();
        context.moveTo(wall.p1.x, wall.p1.y);
        context.lineTo(wall.p2.x, wall.p2.y);
        context.strokeStyle = '#000000';
        context.lineWidth = 1;
        context.stroke();
    context.restore();
});
</pre>
</template>


<template id="3">
<p>
Now it's time to start working on the lighting implementation. We'll do lighting
by taking a point (the light source) and casting rays equally in all directions around it
to check for intersections with walls.
</p>
<p>
For this slide, we'll just worry about getting the unit vectors set up that we'll
use for casting from a light. They'll be the same for every light and won't change, so we can pre-calculate them.
</p>
<pre>
// The light fidelity
const angle_amount = 90;
// The angle between each ray the light casts out
const angle_increment = (Math.PI * 2) / angle_amount;
// Array of unit vectors
const angle_lookup = [];

for (let i = 0; i < angle_amount; ++i) {
    const angle = i * angle_increment;
    const vec_x = Math.cos(angle);
    const vec_y = Math.sin(angle);
    angle_lookup.push({
        x : vec_x,
        y : vec_y
    });
}
</pre>
<p>
It's also best to go over the newly created vectors and polish some of them up.
Near vertical/horizontal vectors can have some crazy small values that can affect
some of the calculations.
</p>
<pre>
for (let i = 0; i < angle_lookup.length; ++i) {
    let angle = angle_lookup[i];
    if (angle.x < 0.000001 && angle.x > -0.000001) {
        angle.x = 0;
    }
    if (angle.x > 0.999999 && angle.x < 1.000001) {
        angle.x = 1;
    }
    if (angle.x < -0.999999 && angle.x > -1.000001) {
        angle.x = -1;
    }
    if (angle.y < 0.000001 && angle.y > -0.000001) {
        angle.y = 0;
    }
    if (angle.y > 0.999999 && angle.y < 1.000001) {
        angle.y = 1;
    }
    if (angle.y < -0.999999 && angle.y > -1.000001) {
        angle.y = -1;
    }
}
</pre>
</template>


<template id="5">
<p>
Time to draw the rays being cast from the light, we'll use the mouse position
on the canvas as the light source.
</p>
<p>
We're going to use another canvas layer for this.
The lights will move around a lot and we don't want to redraw the background image or
walls everytime the light moves. I call this canvas the control canvas and it sits above every canvas we're going
to add. Mainly used for hooking up mouse events, we'll also be drawing our debug output to
it. Here we'll be drawing the light rays coming off of our light source.
<br /><br /><b>IMAGE -> WALL -> CONTROL</b><br />
</p>
<pre>
control_canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
    // Get the position of the canvas in the window
    const rect = control_canvas.canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
    // e.clientX is relative to the window not the canvas
    // subtracting the canvas position gives a mouse
    // x and y coordinate relative to the canvas.
    const pos = {
        x: e.clientX - rect.left,
        y: e.clientY - rect.top
    };

    draw();
});

function draw (pos) {
    drawLightRays(pos, angle_lookup);
}
</pre>
<p>
The drawing for this is extremely similar to the drawing we did for walls.
Almost all of the drawing that we'll be doing is either
singular lines or several connected lines to create a polygon.
</p>
<pre>
// light is the mouse position
// rays is the angle_lookup array we created earlier
function drawLightRays (light, rays) {
    const context = control_context;
    // Clear all previous drawing off the canvas
    clear(context);

    for (let i = 0; i < rays.length; ++i) {
        context.save();
            context.beginPath();
            context.moveTo(light.x, light.y);
            // The unit vector is super short, so multiply it by
            // 10000 to make sure there is an appreciable line to draw
            // Then add it to the light source to get our casted point
            context.lineTo(
                light.x + (rays[i].x * 10000),
                light.y + (rays[i].y * 10000),
            );
            context.strokeStyle = '#000000';
            context.lineWidth = 1;
            context.stroke();
        context.restore();
    }
}
</pre>
</template>


<template id="6">
<p>
Now it's time to add some wall intersection to our light rays. It's fairly straightforward
and uses some horrible looking math.
</p>
<pre>
function getIntersection (r, s) {
    if ((r.dx / r.dy) == (s.dx / s.dy)) return null;

    const t2 = (r.dx * (s.py - r.py) + r.dy * (r.px - s.px)) / (s.dx * r.dy - s.dy * r.dx);
    const t1 = (r.dx != 0) ? (s.px + s.dx * t2 - r.px) / r.dx : (s.py + s.dy * t2 - r.py) / r.dy;

    return {
        x: r.px + (t1 * r.dx),
        y: r.py + (t1 * r.dy),
        t2: t2,
        t1: t1
    };
}
</pre>
<p>
I call the function <code>getLightPolygon</code> because the list of intersect points returned will be connected
to create a polygon that represents the lit up area.
</p>
<pre>
function getLightPolygon (light) {
    // Holds our intersect points that we find for each light ray
    let intersects = [];

    for (let angle_i = 0; angle_i < angle_lookup.length; ++angle_i) {
        const vector = angle_lookup[angle_i];
        const r = {
            px : light.x,
            py : light.y,
            dx : vector.x,
            dy : vector.y
        };

        let closestPoint = {
            x : null,
            y : null,
            t1 : null
        };

        // Go through all of the segments returned for that light/angle quadrant matchup
        for (let w = 0; w < walls.length; ++w) {
            // This will accessed a lot so I'm going with a short variable name
            // "s" in this instance stands for segment
            const s = walls[s_index];

            // Get any intersection info for this light ray and wall.
            const info = getIntersection(r, {
                px : s.temp_p1 ? s.temp_p1.x : s.p1.x,
                py : s.temp_p1 ? s.temp_p1.y : s.p1.y,
                dx : (s.temp_p2 ? s.temp_p2.x : s.p2.x) - (s.temp_p1 ? s.temp_p1.x : s.p1.x),
                dy : (s.temp_p2 ? s.temp_p2.y : s.p2.y) - (s.temp_p1 ? s.temp_p1.y : s.p1.y)
            });

            // Continue to the next wall if there was no intersect info.
            if (!info) continue;

            // If there was intersect info, check if the intersected wall is
            // closer than any previously found wall.
            if (info.t1 >= 0 && info.t2 >= 0 && info.t2 <= 1) {
                if (closestPoint.t1 == null || closestPoint.t1 > info.t1) {
                    closestPoint.x = info.x;
                    closestPoint.y = info.y;
                    closestPoint.t1 = info.t1;
                }
            }
        }

        // t1 is the distance, if there is no distance, something weird happened.
        // Either way, just ignore the wall and move on.
        if (closestPoint.t1 !== null) {
            intersects.push({
                x: Math.round(closestPoint.x),
                y: Math.round(closestPoint.y)

        }
    }

    return intersects;

<template id="7">
<p>
Now that we're finished with those two lovely functions we can get back to the
fun part, which is drawing stuff to the canvas. We'll start by redefining our
draw function that we previously called in the mousemove handler.
</p>

<pre>
function draw (pos) {
    const poly = getLightPolygon(pos);
    drawIntersectPoints(pos, poly);
}

drawIntersectPoints (pos, poly) {
    const context = control_context;
    clear(context);

    context.save();
        for (let i = 0; i < poly.length; ++i) {
            context.beginPath();
            context.moveTo(pos.x, pos.y);
            context.lineTo(poly[i].x, poly[i].y);
            context.strokeStyle = '#000000';
            context.lineWidth = 1;
            context.stroke();
        }
    context.restore();
}
</pre>
</template>


<template id="8">
<p>
Now we're going to draw the important shape, the polygon created by connecting all the
intersect points.
</p>

<pre>
function draw () {
    const poly = getLightPolygon(pos);
    drawIntersectPoints(pos, poly);
    drawLightPolyOutline(poly);
}

drawLightPolyOutline (poly) {
    const context = control_context;
    clear(context);

    context.save();
        context.beginPath();
        context.moveTo(poly[0].x, poly[0].y);
        // Start at one since we just did moveTo on that point
        // Go through and connect all the points.
        for (let i = 1; i < poly.length; ++i) {
            context.lineTo(poly[i].x, poly[i].y);
        }
        context.strokeStyle = '#FF0000';
        context.lineWidth = 4;
        context.stroke();
    context.restore();
}
</pre>
</template>


<template id="9">
<p>
With the intersect points being generated, now we add our shadow canvas layer.
The shadow layer will sit above the image but below the wall and control canvas. I put it below the walls so that we can still
see them clearly for debugging purposes.
<br /><br /><b>IMAGE -> SHADOW -> WALL -> CONTROL</b><br />
</p>
<p>
Let's fill the shadow layer with a slightly transparent color so we can see
behind it, this is just to make sure everything is working properly. In the end
we'll make it fully opaque so we can't see through it.

Every other canvas up to this point has been cleared before we draw to it so it doesn't
show any old data. We won't do that for the shadow layer. It will be filled with our shadow
color at the start of the application and then our light will cut it's light polygon
out of the the shadow layer to show what's behind it.
</p>
<pre>
function drawShadow () {
    const context = shadow_context;
    context.save();
        context.globalAlpha = 0.7;
        context.beginPath();
        context.rect(0, 0, context.width, context.height);
        context.fillStyle = '#000000';
        context.fill();
    context.restore();
}
</pre>
<p>
We'll once again update our draw function to add a new drawing method
</p>
<pre>
function draw () {
    const poly = getLightPolygon(pos);
    drawIntersectPoints(pos, poly);
    drawLightPolyOutline(poly);
    drawLightPolygon(shadow_context, poly);
}

function drawLightPolygon (context, poly) {
    // No clear at the beginning of this draw method
    context.save();
        context.beginPath();
        context.moveTo(poly[0].x, poly[0].y);
        for (let i = 1; i < poly.length; ++i) {
            context.lineTo(poly[i].x, poly[i].y);
        }
        context.fillStyle = rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
        context.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out";
        context.fill();
    context.restore();
    context.globalCompositeOperation = "source-over";
}
</pre>
<p>
Pretty straightforward for what we've done so far except for two big changes...
</p>
<pre>
context.globalCompositeOperation = "destination-out";
context.globalCompositeOperation = "source-over";
</pre>
<p>
<code>"source-over"</code> is the default drawing method. The context restore will reset it
but I also like to set it explicitly.
</p>
<p>
<code>"destination-out"</code> is how we'll remove our polygon from the shadow layer.
</p>
<p>
<code>globalCompositeOperation</code> uses two main targets: "source" and "destination".
</p>
<p>
"source" is what we are currently drawing. It's the shapes
or lines before we do a "stroke" or "fill" operation to actually draw it to the canvas.
</p>
<p>
"destination" is the canvas we are drawing to.
</p>
<p>
We can read the two <code>globalCompositeOperation</code> options like so:
<br />
<code>"source-over"</code>: Take the shapes defined and add them over/ontop of what's already there.
<br />
<code>"destination-out"</code>: Take the shapes defined and cut them out of the destination canvas.
</p>
</template>


<template id="10">
<p>
In the previous example, When you move the mouse around to light up the area, you'll notice
a lot of cutting into walls, especially as the light rays get further out
and more separated.
</p>
<p>
We've been using a low light fidelity so it's easy to see all the intersect
points clearly, but now we can start to bump it up to improve our lighting
accuracy. Let's bump it up to 720 and see what we get.
</p>
<pre>
const angle_amount = 720;
</pre>
<p>
Now it's starting to look pretty good. Performace is still pretty good
even though we're still drawing all our debug data.
</p>
</template>


<template id="11">
<p>
I personally like 720, but let's go ahead and bump it up some more
to see what we get.
</p>
<pre>
const angle_amount = 1440;
</pre>
<p>
There is definitely an improvement, but it starts to become less practical.
In realistic use cases, the small amounts of corner cutting we get with 720
will be unnoticeable, especially once we start removing the debug drawing.
</p>
</template>

<template id="12">
<p>
Taking it up a notch one more time...
</p>
<pre>
const angle_amount = 2880;
</pre>
<p>
It's certainly pretty, but we can start to see how there is really no appreciable
increase in accuracy.
</p>
</template>


<template id="13">
<p>
At this point, unless stated otherwise, the fidelity of the
light will be 720.
</p>
<p>
At this point everything should be looking pretty good, and
our intersection calculations should be working fine, so we can
disable the debug drawing we're doing.
</p>
<pre>
function draw () {
    const poly = getLightPolygon(pos);
    // drawIntersectPoints(pos, poly);
    // drawLightPolyOutline(poly);
    drawLightPolygon(shadow_context, poly);

<template id="14">
<p>
Now we're going to add our last layer, the shroud layer. This will go between
the image and shadow layer. We'll refresh it each time we draw, cutting out only what
the lights currently show.
<br /><br /><b>IMAGE -> SHROUD -> SHADOW -> WALL -> CONTROL</b><br />
</p>
<p>
Since the shroud layer refreshes each draw, the previous parts that we could see
with the light will now have a partially transparent cover to them, allowing us to
still see what was uncovered before, but now shrouded.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of a RPG map application, this lets characters see where
they've been while letting them know they don't have sight to it anymore.

function drawShroud () {
    clear(context);

Some tabletop RPG games like D&D have a vision limit to the characters
if the place they're in is dark, foggy, or not lit up entirely, like a cave or
exploring someplace at night.
</p>
<p>
Currently our light goes until it hits a wall, regardless of how far away it is.
We're going to add some functionality to limit this, and only let characters see
in a small circle around them.
</p>
<p>
We'll be making an adjustment to the <code>getLightPolygon</code> function, down where
we check to make sure our <code>closestPoint</code> found is valid. I'm going to hardcode
light limits here, but it's best to add them in a more configurable location.

// We're also going to change our return value

Our draw function now needs to change to reflect the update return.
We still have the original intersects array, but we won't use it here, for this example
we just want our new <code>bright_intersects</code>.
</p>
<pre>
function draw () {
    const poly = getLightPolygon(pos).bright_intersects;
    drawShroud();
    drawLightPolygon(shroud_context, poly);
    drawLightPolygon(shadow_context, poly);
}

Another vision aspect to some tabletop games is having dim vision. This is what you can see
past you're main vision limit, but not 100% clearly. We're going to use the exact same logic for
the clamping but add another check for another value and create another array.
</p>
<pre>
if (closestPoint.t1 !== null) {
    const bright_limit = 150; // 150 in pixels
    const dim_limit = 450; // 450 pixels

    const sqr_dist = sqr(light.x - closestPoint.x) + sqr(light.y - closestPoint.y);
    if (sqr_dist > sqr(bright_limit)) {
        bright_intersects.push({
            x: Math.round(light.x + (vector.x * bright_limit)),
            y: Math.round(light.y + (vector.y * bright_limit))
        });
    } else {
        bright_intersects.push({
            x: Math.round(closestPoint.x),
            y: Math.round(closestPoint.y)
        });
    }

    if (sqr_dist > sqr(dim_limit)) {
        dim_intersects.push({
            x: Math.round(light.x + (vector.x * dim_limit)),
            y: Math.round(light.y + (vector.y * dim_limit))
        });
    } else {
        dim_intersects.push({
            x: Math.round(closestPoint.x),
            y: Math.round(closestPoint.y)
        });
    }

    intersects.push({
        x: Math.round(closestPoint.x),
        y: Math.round(closestPoint.y)
    });
}
</pre>
<pre>
// Update our return to include the dim vision array
return {
    intersects,
    bright_intersects,
    dim_intersects,
};
</pre>
<p>
Update our draw again to use our dim vision array
</p>
<pre>
function draw () {
    const polys = getLightPolygon(pos);
    drawShroud();
    drawLightPolygon(shroud_context, polys.bright_intersects);
    drawLightPolygon(shadow_context, poly.dim_intersects);
}
</pre>
<p>
We want to cut the small polygon (bright vision) out of the shroud, and the
larger (dim vision) from the shadow layer.

Let's bump the fidelity back up to 2880.
</p>
<p>
One benefit of the limited vision is that the rays we cast from the light
don't go as far, so the increasing separation between the rays won't come into
play in regards to cutting off far away corners.
</p>
<p>
We can see here that the 4x bump in light fidelity has practically zero effect.
</p>
</template>


<template id="18">
<p>
Let's bump the fidelity down up to 360.
</p>
<p>
We can see some of the corner cutting coming back, but its still very minimal.
a fidelity of 360 is definitely acceptable if we're going to use the limited vision.
</p>
</template>

You'll notice this example is completely dark. This is because I've adjusted the shadow
and shroud alphas to 1 and 0.9 respectively. I've also changed the map to be something
more real that has a lot more walls (850 walls vs 42 in the previous examples).
</p>
<p>
What we have is well and good, assuming we just have to manage light for one character.
In D&D however, parties split up or characters are an appreciable distance apart that we really
want multiple lights to help light up our map accurately for each character. I'm not going to show
any code for handling multiple lights, it should be pretty straightforward. The biggest change will
be most of our drawing functions now having an outside loop to go over an array of manage lights.
</p>
<p>
Left clicking on the map will add a light at that spot.
Right clicking will remove all lights and reset the shadow/shroud layers.
*These work on previous example as well
</p>
<p>
We can see a decrease in performance when we start to add around 5-10 lights.
This is because everytime a light moves, it calculates the light polygons for each
light, even the ones that aren't moving. We can handle this easily by having the lights
that we manage all keep a copy of the last light polygon they had. If the light doesnt move
it uses its old values, and any moving lights will use a newly calculate polygon.
</p>
</template>


<template id="20">
<p>
If we add the same amount of lights now we can see that the performance barely drops.
</p>
</template>


<template id="21">
<p>
We can further get a massive performance increase by splitting up the walls into four
quadrants: Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Right.
</p>
<p>
Any segment that crosses between quadrants goes into both quandrant lists. Having duplicate
walls won't hurt light calculations at all and having a few duplicates to check against
is fine for the performance gain we'll get.
</p>
<p>
Our array of light rays to cast will also be split up. Rays that go up to the left will go
in a separate array, and the same for the other directions.
</p>
<p>
The idea behind this separation is that if we have a light located in the top left quadrant and are
testing a light ray that goes in the top left direction, we only need to check the walls in the top left quadrant.
</p>
<p>
The counter to this is that if we have a light located in the top left quadrant and are
testing a light ray that goes in the bottom right direction, we have to check all quadrants. This is fine though
since it's basically what we had before.
</p>
<p>
We get a massive performance increase here because ths guarantees we won't check all walls
</p>
<div class="image">
    <img src="./assets/quadrants.png" />
</div>
<p>
Looking at the image we can make the following conclusions:
<ul>
    <li>Light rays in section 1 only need to test Top Left and Top Right quadrants</li>
    <li>Light rays in section 2 need to check all 4 quadrants</li>
    <li>Light rays in section 3 only need to check Top Left and Bottom Left quadrants</li>
    <li>Light rays in section 4 only need to test the Top Left quadrant</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Now instead of testing:
<br/>
4/4 + 4/4 + 4/4 + 4/4 = 16/16 or 100%
<br/>
we end up testing:
<br/>
2/4 + 4/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 =  9/16 or 56%
</p>
<p>
We now end up only testing a little over half the intersection checks we had
to before, which depending on the map being used, can be thousands of walls.

Welcome to my tutorial on how to make a simple(ish?) lighting application
for use with tabletop games.
</p>
<p>
We'll be using the 2D context instead of WebGL. WebGL is of course capable
of doing whatever we want, but is more complicated and I'm fond of the 2D context
simplicity and wanted to see if this could be done using that.
